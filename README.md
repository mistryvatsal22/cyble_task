# 🔢 Prime Number Checker in Python

This project demonstrates how to check whether a number is **prime** using three different algorithms, each with improved time complexity. It's written in Python and optimized for clarity, efficiency, and scalability.

📌 What Is a Prime Number?

A **prime number** is a natural number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself.

Examples of Prime Numbers:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29...

✅ Features

- Three versions of prime check with increasing efficiency:
  - **Brute Force – O(n)**
  - **Half Range Optimization – O(n/2)**
  - **Square Root Optimization – O(√n)** ✔️ Best

- Easy to test and modify
- Clean and readable code
- Suitable for use in performance-sensitive tasks like cryptography or data validation

Using O(n):
5 → True,
10 → False,
13 → True,
25 → False,
29 → True,

Using O(n/2):
5 → True,
10 → False,
13 → True,
25 → False,
29 → True,

Using O(√n):
5 → True,
10 → False,
13 → True,
25 → False,
29 → True,
